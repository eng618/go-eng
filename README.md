## Overview

This is a personal package I will be using to create various helper packages,
as I learn and explore the Go programming language. The main package of this
repo is simply to demonstrate the use of a subset of the contained packages.

For full documentation visit the individual packages listed in the directories
section [pkg.go.dev/github.com/eng618/go-eng#section-directories](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/eng618/go-eng#section-directories).
